       " ' zackouma national park, chad. djime said, 50, is the lone survivor of a conservation ranger massacre at heban, chad. six zakouma national park rangers died in an attack by poachers who were members of the sudanese military. a few weeks earlier, the rangers found the poachers camp and took all their ammunition, their poached ivory and provisions. the poachers were out of camp at the time. these poachers then planned a counter-attack that began just before first light while the rangers were sleeping. they would have woken to a hail of a.k rounds, the last sound they would ever hear. djime said was employed as a cook with the rangers in the rainy season. in his account, he said the pre-dawn night was very still when suddenly there was heavy firing out of nowhere. he found himself rolling down the steep hill that made up the ranger post at heban. he was shot but managed to hide away for the day and then come back to the camp that night where he confirmed that all the rangers were dead and the camp looted. he spent the next week trying to get help, two days of which were spent wading through a dense swamp on his way to aid. he received $2000 compensation from the chadian government for his injuries but told me he no longer wanted to work for zakouma after this experience. since the time of the attack, the parks ???mamba??? teams have greatly improved security, this coupled with better relations with the nomads in the region have developed an intelligence network that safeguards both the animals and the people trying to protect them. every year many rangers die protecting a global heritage, they work for a pittance and endure conditions most humans would balk at. they do most of that with a smile on their faces. surely we owe them more. #africaparks #zakouma #conservationrangers #natgeo #survivors',\n",

the charts. zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation ngo african parks (@africanparksnetwork). if you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods.what is happening in zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. the park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. more than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory ??? and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. by 2010, only 450 elephants remained. that same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of chad to fully manage zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. they built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. the elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since january 2016.  last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. without the support of local communities this would not work. the park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.  to learn more about zakouma and other truly hopeful conservation efforts happening across africa, please follow @africanparksnetwork', ' the vibrant fall foliage at it???s peak on the slopes

with filth by using only a bucket and a rope.  after finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose.

' a gamekeepers apprentice extinguishing a patchwork of burning heather late into the evening, on invermark, cairngorm national park, scotland - back in the cairngorm national park, scotland for the muir burn - documenting a gamekeepers life - in this extraordinary landscape fire is still a commonly used and controversial agricultural tool, with farmers, crofters and gamekeepers burning grass, heather and gorse. in scotland the season runs from 01 october through 15 april each year. much of the heather burning we see today takes place on grouse moors such as those here in the cairngorm national park, scotland. here for generations gamekeepers have burnt long narrow strips of mature heather on a rotation. how often depends on how quickly the heather becomes both woody and unpalatable, and tall and unavailable. after 2/3 years young heather plants will have regenerated from seed or old stools that survived the fire. if the temperature of the burning is too high, or the grazing pressures are high, the critical balance of growth and competition allows fire and grazing-resistant grass species to become dominant, and the heathland is replaced. by creating a patchwork of different aged heathers a gamekeeper aims to have some young heather for grouse, sheep, deer and mountain hares that is nutritionally richer. patches are burnt every eight to thirty years. to see more

then planned a counter-attack that began just before first light while the rangers were sleeping. they would have woken to a hail of a.k rounds, the last sound they would ever hear. djime said was employed as a cook with the rangers in the rainy season. in his account, he said the pre-dawn night was very still when suddenly there was heavy firing out of nowhere. he found himself rolling down the steep hill that made up the ranger post at heban. he was shot but managed to hide away for the day and then come back to the camp that night where he confirmed that all the rangers were dead and the camp looted. he spent the next week trying to get help, two days of which were spent wading through a dense swamp on his way to aid. he received $2000 compensation from the chadian government for
