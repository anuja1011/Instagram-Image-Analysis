in 1521? ponce de leon brought them on sailing ships from spain during his second voyage to the new world. although he was attacked by calusa indians (and later died of his wounds in havana), cattle and horses remained. when my ancestors migrated into florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the florida woods for nearly three centuries. descendants of these original spanish livestock are called \"\"cracker\"\" cattle and horses today. early american settlers of the florida frontier were also called \"\"crackers\"\", attributed to the \"\"crack\"\" of their cow whips. modern horses actually evolved in north america but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. much of the southeastern us was adapted to grazers. there were herds of wild bison in florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). there are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the northern everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems. cattle grazing in this region has been shown by @archboldstation to increase net carbon sequestration by grasslands. ranches here also provide important wildlife habitat for bears, panthers and other native species while protecting land from

followed marcelino sanz de salutoula to his grave. in the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. paintings like this could not have possibly been made by ice age people. it was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in france that altamira was accepted as genuine. archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the upper solutrean and lower magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 bce). uranium/thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the aurignacian and solutrean periods

onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world.  there are many organisations, ranging from public to private, that support and

shoot 1000 photos in a day. but the workshop leaders encouraged us to trust the process and to be intentional about the moments we tried to capture. by watching and waiting we would know when a moment

' a gamekeepers apprentice extinguishing a patchwork of burning heather late into the evening, on invermark, cairngorm national park, scotland - back in the cairngorm national park, scotland for the muir burn - documenting a gamekeepers life - in this extraordinary landscape fire is still a commonly used and controversial agricultural tool, with farmers, crofters and gamekeepers burning grass, heather and gorse. in scotland the season runs from 01 october through 15 april each year. much of the heather burning we see today takes place on grouse moors such as those here in the cairngorm national park, scotland. here for generations gamekeepers have burnt long narrow strips of mature heather on a rotation. how often depends on how quickly the heather becomes both woody and unpalatable, and tall and unavailable. after 2/3 years young heather plants will have regenerated from seed or old stools that survived the fire. if the temperature of the burning is too high, or the grazing pressures are high, the critical balance of growth and competition allows fire and grazing-resistant grass species to become dominant, and the heathland is replaced. by creating a patchwork of different aged heathers a gamekeeper aims to have some young heather for grouse, sheep, deer and mountain hares that is nutritionally richer. patches are burnt every eight to thirty years. to see more

@nationalgeographicmagazine myself and writer peter gwin examine the current state of #falconry, with an emphasis on the arab world. the arabs have contributed a great deal to the recovery of falcons since the time of the silent spring. they have sponsored nesting sites in mongolia to protect falcons on the steppes, they intensively breed prey species for hunting to minimize impact in host countries and their passion for the sport has led the creation of a new class of captive bred ???super-birds??? that have come to replace much of the illegally trafficked falcon trade from the wild. the falcon hospitals of the uae are something to behold as are the relationships between certain falconers and their birds, far surpassing notions of what is possible between man and raptor. peter and i spent time with the influential master falconer sheik butti al maktoum in the uae and his breeding maestro howard waller. they represent a perfect example of how the natural world can unite people in a common mission despite huge cultural differences. i see great potential for better understanding between islam and the west through the lens of conservation, a higher value system that should unite us in this time of divisiveness. in this story we also examine the deadly effects of electricity pylons and the way they kill millions of raptors every year. in an image seen here, over 300 precious saker falcons lie dead, a tiny sampling collected over one year from a 55 kilometer stretch of powerline in mongolia. millions of raptors are killed in this manner every year. it only requires a small design tweak to prevent this from happening and all future designs could and should include this. #natgeo #falcons #conservation #unitedarabemirates #falconry', ' with his project the
